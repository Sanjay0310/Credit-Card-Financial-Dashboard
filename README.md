Objective: My project aimed to develop a robust Power BI dashboard that provides real-time insights into key performance metrics and trends related to credit card operations. By doing so, we empowered stakeholders to make informed decisions.

üéØ Goals:
Track KPIs and Trends: We closely monitored revenue, transactions, and other critical metrics.
Empower Stakeholders: Real-time data availability allowed stakeholders to act promptly.

üõ†Ô∏è Activities:
Data Integration: We connected to various data sources, including PostgreSQL and Excel, to gather transaction and customer information.
Data Cleaning & Transformation: Ensuring data accuracy and consistency was crucial. We prepared the data for analysis.
Dashboard Design: Our interactive visualizations within Power BI showcased key metrics such as revenue, transactions, customer demographics, and card performance.
Weekly Analysis: Extracting insights from the dashboard, we focused on trends and areas needing further investigation.

üîë Key Findings (Week 52 - December 24, 2023):
Strong Revenue & Transactions: We achieved $55 million in revenue and processed $45 million in transactions year-to-date (YTD).
Customer Insights: Males contributed $30 million in revenue, while females contributed $25 million (YTD).
Top Card Performance: Blue & Silver cards dominated, accounting for 96% of transactions.
Geographic Strength: Texas (TX), New York (NY), and California (CA) drove a significant 66% of transactions.
Healthy Activation Rate: Our positive activation rate stood at 59.4%.
Low Delinquency Rate: Maintaining a 6% delinquency rate is commendable.
